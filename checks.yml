# [QUICK TIP #1]
# For all checks, include the following:
#
# enable:
#   # Do you want to detect this check to Java players?
#   # Default if Bedrock Support is not hooked.
#   java: true
#   # Do you want to detect this check to Bedrock players?
#   bedrock: true
#
# With this, you can specify the player types you want to check: Java or Bedrock players.
# If you don't have Bedrock Support enabled, this option will have no effect and will detect both
# with the option 'java' in true.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# [QUICK TIP #2]
# For all category of checks, this include the following:
#
#  # Optionally, disable this check in specific worlds.
#  disabled-worlds: {}
#
# This allow you to exclude in what worlds you want to disable X category of checks.
# But, how is the format? The format is like this:
#
# disabled-worlds:
# - Auth
# - LuckyWars
#
# In that, you can add more worlds to exclude or exclude a single world, if you want
# disable this feature, only set the value with '{}'.

# Mechanics.
# This prevents players from attempting actions that are not possible within the Minecraft protocol, maintaining the
# integrity of the game mechanics. Legitimate users are unlikely to trigger these checks. Various types of crashers, disablers,
# or hacks can be detected, providing valuable support to the primary anti-cheat system or your anti-crash/anti-exploit
# plugin.
#
# (Instant kick): How does this work?
# This feature forces the server to immediately kick the player using packets (utilizing ProtocolLib). In cases where this
# option fails, it resorts to using Bukkit actions for a standard disconnection. The aim is to swiftly remove the player from
# the game to prevent any attempts at crashing or causing issues. If this option is disabled within a check, the system will
# resort to using the violation level (VL) system. Additionally, a delay has been implemented for each flag in this check to
# prevent issues stemming from excessive VLs.
#
# REMEMBER! Vanilla 1.8 is utilized to ensure adherence to its mechanics, with some inspiration drawn from the specifications
# outlined in https://wiki.vg/Protocol. Should you encounter a false flag or error, disable the check and report it on the Discord
# server for support, if necessary.
